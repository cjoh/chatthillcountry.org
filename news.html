			During 2010, over 50 citizens worked directly to develop a COMPREHENSIVE LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION PLAN for the City of Chattahoochee Hills.  The process began by gathering inputs from public meetings and a survey of the City's citizens.  Over 40% of the households participated - an exceptionally high turnout.  The citizen committees took this input - "Keep it rural" - and developed a plan subsequently approved by City Council and the State of Georgia.  Developing new Zoning Ordinances in 2011-12 reflecting the Plan will follow.

			Utilizing just-published population data from the 2010 Census, Chattahoochee Hills' City Attorney Rick Lindsey developed a plan to realign district boundaries to dramatically improve the balance of population in the five City Council Districts.  Taking great care to protect the racial representation in each district, Lindsey's plan was approved by City Council and submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice for review and approval.  The plan was approved and will be the basis for elections this Fall.  These will be the first elections since Chattahoochee Hills became incorporated in December 2007.
