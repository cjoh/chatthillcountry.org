Trends in our society are keeping people from exposure to nature.&nbsp; Consider the impact of texting, computer games, and security on where children spend their time.&nbsp; It is indoors.&nbsp; An unintentional consequence is that our children are separated from nature - walking in the woods, playing in a stream, seeing wildlife, breathing fresh air.&nbsp; These are much more meaningful that descriptors of &#8220;the good old days.&#8221;&nbsp; Exposure to the features of natural surroundings helps children in numerous ways.&nbsp; Richard Louv presents the scientific case for why we need to spend more time in natural surroundings in LAST CHILD IN THE WOODS and THE NATURE PRINCIPLE.</p>

&#8220;Weather&#8221; used to be a brief forecast at the end of a news program.&nbsp; Now it is the headline.&nbsp; Extremes in weather - tornados, floods, heat waves, drought - are increasingly common.&nbsp; No, it&#8217;s not just more intense journalism.&nbsp; It is global climate change, and it is already happening.&nbsp; HOT, LIVING THROUGH THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS ON EARTH by Mark Hertsgaard is a &#8220;must read.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>
