<h1>Chattahoochee Hill Country Communities</h1>


<p>CHC includes portions of four counties: Carroll, Coweta, Douglas, and Fulton.&nbsp; Approximately 33,000 acres in Fulton County was incorporated as the City of Chattahoochee Hills in December 2007.&nbsp; The remaining area is unincorporated.&nbsp; A 98-mile trail is planned to interconnect all parts of the CHC.&nbsp; Implementing this plan is a long-term project, with the first trail segment completed is in the Boundary Waters Park in Douglas County. </p>

<p>The neighborhoods to be developed are described as &#8220;smart growth&#8221; or new urbanism.&nbsp; The Serenbe Community is a development of this type in Chattahoochee Hills.&nbsp; It can be described as green or sustainable or a new urban community planted in the country.</p>

<p>Chattahoochee Hills is a young city with high expectations and modest resources.&nbsp; The City is resourceful and welcomes volunteers.&nbsp; Being a small city provides residents with opportunities to have an impact, to make a difference that will effect generations to come.</p>
