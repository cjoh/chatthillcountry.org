<h1>Welcome!</h1>


<p>The Chattahoochee Hill Country (CHC) is a 65,000 acre area southwest of Atlanta.&nbsp; It is one of the last undeveloped and rural areas located within 30 minutes of Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the busiest airport in the world.&nbsp; It includes rolling hills, streams, forests and farms and a population of about 3,000 people.</p>

<p>This web site presents the CHC through the lens of the Chattahoochee Hill Country Conservancy, Inc. (the &#8220;Conservancy&#8221;).&nbsp; The Conservancy is a non-profit organization which seeks to preserve the natural fields and forests that comprise our rural vistas.</p>
