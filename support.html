<h1>Support the Conservancy</h1>


<p>It takes &#8220;green&#8221; to keep it &#8220;green.&#8221;&nbsp;  In other words, conservation costs money. The Conservancy depends on contributions from individuals and corporations and grants from foundations.&nbsp; If you would like to help the Conservancy preserve green space in CHC, please mail your check payable to CHC Conservancy to 6505-A Rico Road, Chattahoochee Hills, GA 30268.&nbsp; We will send you a letter acknowledging your thoughtful gift.</p>

<p>Conservation Easements are one key to preserving green space.&nbsp; A landowner can elect to separate the right to build houses on property by creating a conservation easement.&nbsp; The Conservation Easement is tailored to the land and the owner&#8217;s wishes, and it becomes a permanent part of the deed for that property.&nbsp; It is a &#8220;promise&#8221; that houses, offices and factories will never, ever be built on the specified property.</p>

<p>A land owner can donate a Conservation Easement to the Conservancy.&nbsp; The land owner is then entitled to use the value of that Conservation Easement as a charitable deduction on their Federal and Georgia Income Tax Returns.&nbsp; In addition, because the land cannot be developed, the appraised value and property taxes are reduced.</p>

<p>A land owner can also sell the Conservation Easement via a Transfer of Development Rights (TDR&#8217;s).&nbsp; The sale can be directly between the landowner from the &#8220;giving area&#8221; to a land owner in a &#8220;receiving area.&#8221;&nbsp; Or the Conservancy can act as a TDR Bank and buy TDR&#8217;s now for future sale.&nbsp; The landowner in the receiving area, typically a developer, can be entitled to build more houses per acre than the Zoning would otherwise allow.</p>
