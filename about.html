<p>The Chattahoochee Hill Country (CHC) is a 65,000 acre area southeast of Atlanta.&nbsp; It is one of the last undeveloped and rural areas located within 30 minutes of Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the busiest airport in the world.&nbsp; It includes rolling hills, streams, forests and farms and a population of about 3,000 people.</p>

<p>Geographically, the CHC is comprised of the City of Chattahoochee Hills (in Fulton County) and adjoining portions of Douglas, Carroll and Coweta Counties.&nbsp; The City of Chattahoochee Hills includes 33,000 acres with a population of about 2400 people (2010 census).</p>

<p>The residents of CHC want to retain the natural beauty of this unspoiled area, yet realize that development is inevitable.&nbsp; We seek two goals: to preserve our rural vistas and heritage (about 60% of the land) and to concentrate sustainable development primarily along South Fulton Parkway, the major connection with Atlanta.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;There is no heavier burden than a great opportunity.&#8221;&nbsp; </i></p>

<p>We have the opportunity to &#8220;do it right&#8221; by preserving natural resources and creating communities which will enrich future generations of residents.&nbsp; We know we do not want suburban sprawl which contributes to global climate change and which hinders the building to real community.</p>

<p>Hours spent driving from one place to another prevents people from being neighbors and establishing friendships within the community.&nbsp; Part of our CHC rural heritage is &#8220;neighbor helping neighbor.&#8221;&nbsp; As new neighborhoods are developed, we would like that heritage transformed to &#8220;neighbors being friends with neighbors.&#8221;</p>
