<h1>CHC Sustainable Village Model</h1>


<p>Chattahoochee Hill Country is the first recipient of the Atlanta Regional Commission Livable Centers Initiative &#8220;Greenfields&#8221; Award.</p>

<p>Since almost 50% of Atlanta&#8217;s growth over the next 15 years is projected to occur in undeveloped areas, the ARC has established this new category for land use planning. </p>

<p>In the spring of 2003, the ARC awarded this LCI study grant to Fulton County/CHC for $70,000 to develop a high-density, mixed-use model village plan. Fulton County matched $17,000 of the ARC grant. Fulton County solicited bids from qualified architectural and engineering firms and awarded the contract to Ecos Environmental Design in July, 2003. </p>

<p>The public participated in the design process through a series of meetings during the fall of 2003. The design process was completed in December, 2003. The sustainable village model has been submitted to the Atlanta Regional Commission. If the design meets with their approval, the ARC may provide Livable Centers Initiative funds for implementation in the future.</p>
