<b> Annual Report for 2010<b></p>

<p>The Conservancy focused on two topics in 2010.&nbsp; One was supporting citizen efforts to develop the Comp Plan for Chattahoochee Hills.&nbsp; Georgia requires every municipality to have and update a Comprehensive Land Use and Transportation Plan.&nbsp; Since its incorporation in 2007, this was the first Comp Plan for Chattahoochee Hills.&nbsp; A comp Plan must represent the vision and desires of citizens in defining that the citizens want their city to be and to become.&nbsp; &#8220;Keep it rural&#8221; is the overwhelming message in Chattahoochee Hills.&nbsp; Members of the Conservancy Board served on various committees to define what is meant by &#8220;rural,&#8221; and to describe the desired consequences of the Comp Plan.&nbsp; <br />
In 2011, the City will embark on rewriting Zoning Ordinances to reflect the Comp Plan.&nbsp; The future of Transfers of Development Rights will be discussed and decided in the context of the new Zoning Ordinances.&nbsp; During 2010, there were no new TDR&#8217;s.&nbsp; The two properties covered by existing TDR&#8217;s were monitored to assure compliance with the Conservation Easements.<br />
Management of the parks which the City of Chattahoochee Hills purchased from Fulton County was another area of concern for the Conservancy.&nbsp; The Conservancy worked with other citizens of Chattahoochee Hills to determine how best to organize volunteer efforts to support the City&#8217;s new parks.&nbsp; Final resolution is expected in 2011.</p>
