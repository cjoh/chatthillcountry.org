<p><b>Privacy Statement</b></p>

<p>Chattahoochee Hill Country Conservancy (&#8220;CHCC&#8221;) has created this privacy statement to demonstrate its firm commitment to privacy by informing site visitors of our data collection and storage practices, and guidelines for use of visitor data.</p>

<p>The following statements detail information gathering and dissemination practices for Chattahoochee Hill Country Conservancy, located at <a href="http://chatthillcountry.org">http://chatthillcountry.org</a> and any other associated sites using the chatthillcountry.org domain.</p>

<p><b>User Tracking and Data Capture Practices</b><br />
Our servers collect and aggregate user information site-wide, including anonymous site statistics, such as the number of views of each page. We log domain names and/or IP addresses of visitors (such as umich.edu, aol.com, 209.168.1.1, etc.), which permits us to know &#8220;where&#8221; visitors are from, or what access service they use, without knowing their individual identities. Because we do not require users to register with us, this &#8220;host level&#8221; tracking is our primary basis for assessing traffic patterns.</p>

<p>On certain pages, we give users the option of providing us with names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, and other personal information, and various other kinds of details. This more personal information is gathered only with users&#8217; knowing and active permission and participation.</p>

<p>Chattahoochee Hill Country Conservancy Website does not use any cookies that are automatically written to your computer&#8217;s hard drive or retained by CHCC or our vendors.</p>

<p>The CHCC Website does set &#8220;session specific cookies&#8221; to help run its interactive online applications, such as the shopping cart. The session specific cookies only exist in your computer&#8217;s short term memory (RAM) and only exist as long as the session lasts. They expire (disappear from your computer&#8217;s memory) when the session ends. These cookies will NOT be written to a user&#8217;s hard drive. Under no circumstance will any information associated with these cookies be retained or used by CHCC or its vendors after the session is completed.</p>

<p>In addition, the third party email management provider that oversees the CHCC&#8217;s newsletter distribution and data handling (see section below) will use cookies for the sole purpose of ensuring that an individual user can only access his/her personal profile and subscription information. This prevents a user from accessing or viewing another subscriber&#8217;s personal or subscription information. By contract with the CHCA, the vendor will not transfer or sell any information that it collects from users of the CHCA Website to a third party.</p>

<p>On some pages, users can sign up to receive additional information by email through an email subscription service (as discussed below), or by other means, including postal mail. Personal information that has been volunteered to us may also be combined with data from third parties, such as Congressional district maps, to improve our services to members. No such combining will be done for marketing purposes.</p>

<p>Email addresses of visitors and members are never exchanged with other organizations except as provided for in the section on email list subscriptions below.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Website, you can contact:</p>
